I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Virginia, advised by Prof. Felix Xiaozhu Lin.
My research lies at the intersection of **Systems and Machine Learning**, 
focusing on efficient inference frameworks that minimize latency and memory consumption. 
Previously, I have worked on low-level optimizations in the Linux kernel.
